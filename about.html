            <h4>Bikur: A Unique Culinary Experience Beyond Traditional Bacon</h4>
            <p class="text">
              Bikur goes beyond traditional definitions of bacon; it’s a culinary masterpiece that breaks the limits of classic bacon—often limited to pork—and is designed for various meats such as beef, lamb, chicken, duck, goose, salmon, tuna, and more. At Bikur, inspired by the diversity of tastes and food cultures around the world, we produce bacons that not only respect different preferences but also set a new standard in quality, flavor, and dining experience. Just try Bikur once, and you'll remember the unforgettable taste forever.

            <h4>Crafted Through a Precise and Natural Process</h4>
            <p>
              Every slice of Bikur is the result of a time-consuming, sensitive, and highly specialized process that can take several days and uses 35 to 45 completely natural ingredients. From the careful selection of high-quality meats to the complex marinating and cooking steps, each phase is carried out with precision and attention to detail to produce a soft, tender, yet nutritious product.
            </p>

            <h4>Innovative Cooking Techniques for Maximum Flavor and Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
              Thanks to innovative techniques like sous-vide cooking, Bikur offers a uniform texture and deep flavor, maintaining a semi-rare state while preserving the meat’s nutritional value. The cold-smoking process, with an artistic blend of natural woods and fruit peels, gives each meat a distinctive aroma and taste tailored to it.

By relying on pure ingredients like rock salt, olive oil, and natural spices—without using artificial colors or chemical additives—we’ve created a healthy, innovative, and visually appealing product.
