            <h4>Bicor: A Unique Flavor, A Global Experience for Every Taste</h4>
            <p class="text">
              Bicor transcends the traditional boundaries of bacon. It’s not just bacon—it’s a culinary masterpiece that breaks free from the classic pork-only definition, crafted for a variety of meats including beef, lamb, chicken, duck, goose, salmon, tuna, and more. Inspired by the diverse palates and culinary cultures of the world, Bicor creates products that not only cater to varied tastes but also set a new standard in quality, flavor, and dining experience. One taste of Bicor is all it takes to leave an unforgettable impression.

            <h4>A Meticulous Process Fueled by Passion and Craftsmanship</h4>
            <p class="text">
              Every slice of Bicor is the result of a meticulous, time-intensive, and highly specialized process that can take several days and incorporates 35 to 45 all-natural ingredients. From carefully selecting premium meats to intricate marination and cooking stages, each step is executed with precision and care to produce a product that’s tender, delicate, and nutrient-rich.

            <h4>Sous-Vide Perfection and Cold-Smoked Artistry</h4>
            <p class="text">
              At Bicor, we employ the advanced sous-vide cooking technique, recognized as the most innovative and ideal method in modern cuisine. This gentle, precisely controlled low-temperature cooking preserves the meat’s nutritional value while retaining its natural juices, delivering a uniform texture, deep flavor, and a rare, succulent finish. Additionally, our cold-smoking process, using a masterful blend of natural woods and fruit peels, imparts a distinctive aroma and flavor tailored to each type of meat.

Bicor stands out not only for its exceptional taste but also for its natural, striking color. Using only natural ingredients and spices—without artificial colors or chemical additives—we’ve crafted a healthy, innovative, and visually stunning product.
